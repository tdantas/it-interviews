# Reverse Binary

##Task

Your task will be to write a program for reversing numbers in binary. For instance, the binary representation of 13 is 1101, and reversing it gives 1011, which corresponds to number 11.


###Input
The input contains a single line with an integer N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000.

###Output
Output one line with one integer, the number we get by reversing the binary representation of N.
